**Game character voice lines + visual overlay notifications when your AI coding agent needs attention — or let the agent pick its own sound via MCP.**

AI coding agents don't notify you when they finish or need permission. You tab away, lose focus, and waste 15 minutes getting back into flow. peon-ping fixes this with voice lines and bold on-screen banners from Warcraft, StarCraft, Portal, Zelda, and more — works with **Claude Code**, **Amp**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Codex**, **Cursor**, **OpenCode**, **Kilo CLI**, **Kiro**, **Kimi Code**, **Windsurf**, **Google Antigravity**, **Rovo Dev CLI**, **DeepAgents**, **Qwen Code**, **iFlow CLI**, **Trae**, **Kiro IDE**, **ECA**, and any MCP client.

## Install

### Option 1: Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install PeonPing/tap/peon-ping
```

Then run `peon-ping-setup` to register hooks and download sound packs. macOS and Linux.

### Option 2: Installer script (macOS, Linux, WSL2)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/main/install.sh | bash
```

⚠️ **WSL2 audio notes.** peon-ping plays audio on the Windows side. On first run it probes your Windows host once (cached per Windows build) to pick the best playback path:

- On **Windows 10 / Windows 11 pre-24H2**, WPF MediaPlayer is used directly — native MP3 + WAV, no extra dependencies.
- On **Windows 11 24H2+** (build 26100+), Microsoft removed legacy Windows Media Player from the OS and WPF MediaPlayer fails (`MILAVERR_INVALIDWMPVERSION`). peon-ping falls back to `System.Media.SoundPlayer`, which uses the Win32 `PlaySound` API and works everywhere — but it's WAV-only, so MP3 packs require **ffmpeg** to transcode on the fly:

  ```sh
  sudo apt update; sudo apt install -y ffmpeg
  ```

You can override the auto-detection with `PEON_WSL_AUDIO_BACKEND=auto|mediaplayer|soundplayer`:

- `auto` (default) — probe + cache as described above
- `mediaplayer` — force WPF MediaPlayer over the WSL UNC path (fails silently on 24H2+)
- `soundplayer` — force tmpfile copy + `SoundPlayer` (universal, requires ffmpeg for non-WAV files)

### Option 3: Installer for Windows

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/main/install.ps1" -OutFile ".\install.ps1" -UseBasicParsing
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
```

Installs a curated starter set of packs by default. Re-run to update while preserving config/state. Or **[pick your packs interactively at peonping.com](https://peonping.com/#picker)** and get a custom install command.

Windows installer parameters:

- `-All` — install all available packs
- `-Packs peon,sc_kerrigan,...` — install specific packs only
- `-Lang en,fr,...` — install only packs matching language(s)
- `-Local` — install packs, config, hooks, and skills into `./.claude/` for the current project
- `-Global` — explicit global install (same as default)
- `-InitLocalConfig` — create `./.claude/hooks/peon-ping/config.json` only

`-Local` does not install the global `peon` CLI shim or modify your user `PATH`. Hooks are registered in the project-level `./.claude/settings.json` with absolute paths so they work from any working directory within the project.

Windows examples:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1 -All
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1 -Packs peon,sc_kerrigan
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1 -Local
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1 -InitLocalConfig
```

If the initial download fails with a TLS error on older Windows PowerShell, run this once in the same session and retry:

```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
```

### Option 4: Clone and inspect first

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping.git
cd peon-ping
./install.sh
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping.git
Set-Location peon-ping
.\install.ps1
```

### Option 5: Nix (macOS, Linux)

Run directly from source without installing:

```bash
nix run github:PeonPing/peon-ping -- status
nix run github:PeonPing/peon-ping -- packs install peon
```

Or install to your profile:

```bash
nix profile install github:PeonPing/peon-ping
```

Development shell (bats, shellcheck, nodejs):

```bash
nix develop  # or use direnv
```

#### Home Manager module (declarative configuration)

For reproducible setups, use the Home Manager module:

```nix
# In your home.nix or flake.nix
{ inputs, pkgs, ... }:

let
  peonCursorAdapterPath = "${inputs.peon-ping.packages.${pkgs.system}.default}/share/peon-ping/adapters/cursor.sh";
in {
  imports = [ inputs.peon-ping.homeManagerModules.default ];

  programs.peon-ping = {
    enable = true;
    package = inputs.peon-ping.packages.${pkgs.system}.default;
    claudeCodeIntegration = true;

    settings = {
      default_pack = "glados";
      volume = 0.7;
      enabled = true;
      desktop_notifications = true;
      categories = {
        "session.start" = true;
        "task.complete" = true;
        "task.error" = true;
        "input.required" = true;
        "resource.limit" = true;
        "user.spam" = true;
      };
    };

    # Install packs from og-packs (simple string notation)
    # and custom sources (attrset with name + src)
    installPacks = [
      "peon"
      "glados"
      "sc_kerrigan"
      # Custom pack from GitHub (openpeon.com registry)
      {
        name = "mr_meeseeks";
        src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
          owner = "kasperhendriks";
          repo = "openpeon-mrmeeseeks";
          rev = "main";  # or use a commit hash for reproducibility
          sha256 = "sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=";
        };
      }
    ];
    enableZshIntegration = true;
  };

  # Optional extra IDE hooks, like Cursor
  home.file.".cursor/hooks.json".text = builtins.toJSON {
    version = 1;
    hooks = {
      afterAgentResponse = [{ command = "bash ${peonCursorAdapterPath} afterAgentResponse"; }];
      stop               = [{ command = "bash ${peonCursorAdapterPath} stop"; }];
    };
  };
}
```

**Sound pack installation**: The `installPacks` option supports two formats:
- **Simple strings** (e.g., `"peon"`, `"glados"`) — fetched from the [og-packs](https://github.com/PeonPing/og-packs) repository
- **Custom sources** — attrset with `name` and `src` fields, where `src` can be any Nix fetcher result (e.g., `pkgs.fetchFromGitHub`)

For packs listed on [openpeon.com](https://openpeon.com/), find the GitHub repository link and use `pkgs.fetchFromGitHub`:
```nix
{
  name = "pack_name";
  src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "github-owner";
    repo = "repo-name";
    rev = "main";  # or a commit hash/tag
    sha256 = "";   # Leave empty first, Nix will tell you the correct hash
  };
}
```

**Claude Code hooks**: set `programs.peon-ping.claudeCodeIntegration = true;` to install the Claude Code hook scripts under `~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/` and merge the standard peon-ping hook entries into `~/.claude/settings.json`.

**Other IDE hooks**: adapters for other IDEs are still opt-in so the module does not overwrite unrelated IDE settings. peon-ping provides adapter scripts such as `cursor.sh` in [`adapters/`](https://github.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/tree/main/adapters), and you can wire them like this:
  ```sh
  ${inputs.peon-ping.packages.${pkgs.system}.default}/share/peon-ping/adapters/$YOUR_IDE.sh EVENT_NAME
  ```
  See the Cursor example above.

## What you'll hear

| Event | CESP Category | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Session starts | `session.start` | *"Ready to work!"*, *"Something need doing?"* |
| Task finishes | `task.complete` | *"Work complete."*, *"Work, work."* |
| Agent acknowledged task | `task.acknowledge` | *"I can do that."*, *"Be happy to."*, *"Okie dokie."* *(disabled by default)* |
| Permission needed | `input.required` | *"Hmm?"*, *"What you want?"*, *"Yes?"* |
| Tool or command error | `task.error` | *"Me not that kind of orc!"*, *"Ugh."* |
| Rate or token limit hit | `resource.limit` | *"Why not?"* |
| Rapid prompts (3+ in 10s) | `user.spam` | *"Whaaat?"*, *"Me busy, leave me alone!"*, *"No time for play."* |

Plus **large overlay banners** on every screen (macOS/WSL/MSYS2) and terminal tab titles (`● project: done`) — you'll know something happened even if you're in another app.

peon-ping implements the [Coding Event Sound Pack Specification (CESP)](https://github.com/PeonPing/openpeon) — an open standard for coding event sounds that any agentic IDE can adopt.

## Quick controls

Need to mute sounds and notifications during a meeting or pairing session? Two options:

| Method | Command | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Slash command** | `/peon-ping-toggle` | While working in Claude Code |
| **CLI** | `peon toggle` | From any terminal tab |

Prefer it to happen automatically? Set [`focus_detect`](#configuration) to have peon-ping honor macOS **Focus / Do Not Disturb**. Sounds and notifications go quiet whenever a Focus is on and resume when you turn it off. See also `headphones_only` and `meeting_detect`.

Other CLI commands:

> Windows note: Windows currently supports the day-one controls (`status`, `toggle`, `volume`, core `packs`, `notifications on/off`, `debug`, `logs`, `trainer`). More advanced commands like `setup`, `rotation`, `preview`, and `mobile` are tracked as follow-up Windows parity work.

```bash
peon setup                # Interactive setup wizard (volume, categories, notifications)
peon pause                # Mute sounds
peon resume               # Unmute sounds

```

Available CESP categories for `peon preview`: `session.start`, `task.acknowledge`, `task.complete`, `task.error`, `input.required`, `resource.limit`, `user.spam`. (Extended categories `session.end` and `task.progress` are defined in the CESP spec and supported by pack manifests, but not currently triggered by built-in hook events.)

Tab completion is supported — type `peon packs use <TAB>` to see available pack names.

Pausing mutes sounds and desktop notifications instantly. Persists across sessions until you resume. Tab titles remain active when paused.

## Configuration

### Quickstart — `peon setup`

The fastest way to configure peon-ping is the interactive wizard:

```bash
peon setup
```

It walks you through every common setting in one go — press **Enter** at any prompt to keep the current value:

```
  ╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║       peon-ping  setup wizard        ║
  ╚══════════════════════════════════════╝

  ── Volume ──
  > Volume (0.0 - 1.0) (0.5):

  ── Sound categories ──
  >   Session start [on/off] (on):
  >   Task acknowledge [on/off] (off):
  >   Task complete [on/off] (on):
  >   Task error [on/off] (on):
  >   Input required (permissions, questions) [on/off] (on):
  >   Resource limit (context compaction) [on/off] (on):
  >   User spam (rapid prompts) [on/off] (on):

  ── Notifications ──
  > Desktop notifications [on/off] (on):

  Overlay theme:
    1) Neon (cyberpunk)
    2) Glass (translucent)
    3) Sakura (cherry blossom)
    4) Jarvis (iron man)
  > Theme [neon]:

  Notification position:
    1) Top center
    2) Top right
    ...
  > Position [top-center]:

  Auto-dismiss:
    1) Persistent (click to dismiss)
    2) 3 seconds
    3) 4 seconds
    ...
  > Dismiss time [4]:

  ✓ Configuration saved!
```

**What the wizard covers:**
- **Volume** — playback volume (0.0 – 1.0)
- **Sound categories** — enable/disable each CESP category individually (session start, task complete, permission prompts, errors, etc.)
- **Desktop notifications** — master switch for overlay banners
- **Overlay theme** — choose the visual style (neon, glass, sakura, jarvis)
- **Position** — where notifications appear (top-center, top-right, etc.)
- **Auto-dismiss** — how long notifications stay visible (`0` = persistent, click to dismiss)

When you're done, the wizard prints a summary and saves everything to `~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/config.json`. You can rerun `peon setup` anytime to tweak settings — it always shows your current values as defaults.

> **Tip:** All individual `peon` subcommands (`peon volume`, `peon notifications position top-right`, etc.) still work if you prefer scripting or tweaking one setting at a time — see the [Quick controls](#quick-controls) section.

### Slash commands and manual config

peon-ping also installs slash commands in Claude Code:

- `/peon-ping-toggle` — mute/unmute sounds
- `/peon-ping-config` — change any setting (volume, packs, categories, etc.)
- `/peon-ping-rename <name>` — give this session a custom name shown in notification titles and the terminal tab title (zero tokens, hook-intercepted); no argument resets to auto-detect

You can also just ask Claude to change settings for you — e.g. "enable round-robin pack rotation", "set volume to 0.3", or "add glados to my pack rotation". No need to edit config files manually.

Config location depends on install mode:

- Global install: `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/hooks/peon-ping/config.json` (default `~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/config.json`)
- Local install: `./.claude/hooks/peon-ping/config.json`

```json
{
  "volume": 0.5,
  "categories": {
    "session.start": true,
    "task.acknowledge": true,
    "task.complete": true,
    "task.error": true,
    "input.required": true,
    "resource.limit": true,
    "user.spam": true
  }
}
```

### Independent Controls

peon-ping has three independent controls that can be mixed and matched:

| Config Key | Controls | Affects Sounds | Affects Desktop Popups | Affects Mobile Push |
|------------|----------|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| `enabled` | Master audio switch | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| `desktop_notifications` | Desktop popup banners | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| `mobile_notify.enabled` | Phone push notifications | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

This means you can:
- Keep sounds but disable desktop popups: `peon notifications off`
- Keep desktop popups but disable sounds: `peon pause`
- Enable mobile push without desktop popups: set `desktop_notifications: false` and `mobile_notify.enabled: true`

- **volume**: 0.0–1.0 (quiet enough for the office)
- **desktop_notifications**: `true`/`false` — toggle desktop notification popups independently from sounds (default: `true`). When disabled, sounds continue playing but visual popups are suppressed. Mobile notifications are unaffected.
- **notification_style**: `"overlay"` or `"standard"` — controls how desktop notifications appear (default: `"overlay"`)
  - **overlay**: large, visible banners — JXA Cocoa overlay on macOS, Windows Forms popup on WSL/MSYS2. Clicking the overlay focuses your terminal (supports Ghostty, Warp, iTerm2, Zed, Terminal.app). On iTerm2, clicking focuses the correct tab/pane/window — not just the app.
  - **standard**: system notifications — [`terminal-notifier`](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier) / `osascript` on macOS, Windows toast on WSL/MSYS2. When `terminal-notifier` is installed (`brew install terminal-notifier`), clicking a standard notification focuses your terminal automatically (supports Ghostty, Warp, iTerm2, Zed, Terminal.app). On native Windows, clicking a toast notification focuses the IDE or terminal window (supports VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Windows Terminal, PowerShell). With multiple windows open, the notification targets the exact window that originated the event via PID-based process tree matching.
- **overlay_theme**: `"jarvis"`, `"glass"`, `"sakura"`, or omit for the default overlay — macOS only (default: none)
  - **jarvis**: circular HUD with rotating arcs, graduation ticks, and progress ring
  - **glass**: glassmorphism panel with accent color bar, progress line, and timestamp
  - **sakura**: zen garden with bonsai tree and animated cherry blossom petals
- **categories**: Toggle individual CESP sound categories on/off (e.g. `"session.start": false` to disable greeting sounds)
- **annoyed_threshold / annoyed_window_seconds**: How many prompts in N seconds triggers the `user.spam` easter egg
- **silent_window_seconds**: Suppress `task.complete` sounds and notifications for tasks shorter than N seconds. (e.g. `10` to only hear sounds for tasks that take longer than 10 seconds)
- **session_start_cooldown_seconds** (number, default: `30`): Deduplicates greeting sounds when multiple workspaces start at the same time (e.g. opening OpenCode or Cursor with many folders). Only the first session start plays the greeting; subsequent ones within this window stay silent. Set to `0` to disable deduplication and always play a greeting.
- **suppress_idle_prompt_repeats** (boolean, default: `true`): Claude Code re-fires its `idle_prompt` notification every ~60s while the terminal is unfocused. peon-ping routes `idle_prompt` to `task.complete` so you still get a sound when input is needed — but without dedupe the same sound replays on every poke. When `true`, an `idle_prompt` is suppressed if a `task.complete` for the same session already fired inside `idle_prompt_suppress_window_seconds`. Set to `false` to restore the periodic nudge.
- **idle_prompt_suppress_window_seconds** (number, default: `3600`): Window used by `suppress_idle_prompt_repeats`. After a `task.complete` fires for a session, subsequent `idle_prompt` notifications for that session stay silent for this many seconds. Set to `0` to disable the window (effectively the same as `suppress_idle_prompt_repeats: false`).
- **suppress_subagent_complete** (boolean, default: `false`): Suppress sounds and notifications from sub-agent activity. When Claude Code's Task tool dispatches parallel sub-agents, each one fires its own events: a completion sound on finish, `task.error` on failed Bash commands, `input.required` on permission requests. Set this to `true` to hear only the parent session's sounds. Events fired from inside a sub-agent are detected via the `agent_id` field Claude Code adds to their hook payloads; separate-session sub-agents (older clients, other IDEs) are still detected by the SubagentStart timing heuristic.
- **default_pack**: The fallback pack used when no more specific rule applies (default: `"peon"`). Replaces the old `active_pack` key — existing configs are migrated automatically on `peon update`.
- **path_rules**: Array of `{ "pattern": "...", "pack": "..." }` objects. Assigns a pack to sessions based on the working directory using glob matching (`*`, `?`). First matching rule wins. Beats `pack_rotation` and `default_pack`; overridden by `session_override` assignments.
  ```json
  "path_rules": [
    { "pattern": "*/work/client-a/*", "pack": "glados" },
    { "pattern": "*/personal/*",      "pack": "peon" }
  ]
  ```
- **exclude_dirs**: Array of glob or directory patterns. If the current working directory matches one of these entries, **all sounds and notifications are silenced** for that invocation (the hook logs `suppressed=True reason=excluded_dir pattern=<match>`). Bare directory paths also match descendants, so `"~/conductor/workspaces"` silences everything under that tree. Use this for noisy background agents (e.g. `CodexBar/ClaudeProbe`), throwaway scratch dirs, or sensitive workspaces where audio alerts are unwanted.
  ```json
  "exclude_dirs": [
    "~/conductor/workspaces",
    "~/Library/Application Support/CodexBar*"
  ]
  ```
- **ide_rules**: Array of `{ "ide": "...", "pack": "..." }` objects. Assigns a pack by IDE/source after `path_rules` and before rotation/default fallback. First matching rule wins. Common ids: `claude`, `codex`, `cursor`, `opencode`, `kilo`, `kiro`, `gemini`, `copilot`, `windsurf`, `kimi`, `antigravity`, `amp`, `deepagents`, `openclaw`, `rovodev`.
  ```json
  "ide_rules": [
    { "ide": "codex",  "pack": "glados" },
    { "ide": "claude", "pack": "peon" }
  ]
  ```
- **pack_rotation**: Array of pack names (e.g. `["peon", "sc_kerrigan", "peasant"]`). Used when `pack_rotation_mode` is `random` or `round-robin`. Leave empty `[]` to use `default_pack` (or `path_rules` / `ide_rules`) only.
- **pack_rotation_mode**: `"random"` (default), `"round-robin"`, or `"session_override"`. With `random`/`round-robin`, each session picks one pack from `pack_rotation`. With `session_override`, the `/peon-ping-use <pack>` command assigns a pack per session. Invalid or missing packs fall back through the hierarchy. (`"agentskill"` is accepted as a legacy alias for `"session_override"`.)
- **session_ttl_days** (number, default: 7): Expire stale per-session pack assignments older than N days. Keeps `.state.json` from growing unbounded when using `session_override` mode.
- **headphones_only** (boolean, default: `false`): Only play sounds when headphones or external audio devices are detected. When enabled, sounds are suppressed if built-in speakers are the active output — useful for open offices. Check status with `peon status`. Supported on macOS (via `system_profiler`) and Linux (via PipeWire `wpctl` or PulseAudio `pactl`).
- **terminal_tab_title** (boolean, default: `true`): Update the terminal tab title with the current session status (for example `● project: done`). Set to `false` if you already manage tab titles with your own shell prompt or terminal automation and only want peon-ping's sounds/notifications.
- **tmux_passthrough** (boolean, default: `false`): Pass the tab title and iTerm2 tab-color escapes through tmux's DCS passthrough to the host terminal (requires tmux 3.3a+ with `set -g allow-passthrough on`). Off by default because a tmux client multiplexes many panes/windows onto a single host terminal tab with no per-pane addressing: when several agent sessions run at once, every hook (including from background panes) repaints that one shared tab on a last-writer-wins basis, so it no longer reflects any single session. Leave it off and let tmux's own window/status line carry per-session state; enable it only if you run one tmux window per terminal tab (so 1 tab = 1 session). Has no effect outside tmux, where the escapes are always emitted.
- **suppress_sound_when_tab_focused** (boolean, default: `false`): Skip sound playback when the terminal tab that generated the hook event is the currently active/focused tab. Sounds still play for background tabs as an alert that something happened elsewhere. Desktop and mobile notifications are unaffected. Useful when you only want audio cues from tabs you're not watching. macOS only (uses `osascript` to check frontmost app and iTerm2 tab focus).
- **meeting_detect** Detects if the microphone is currently being used and temporarily suppresses the audio only until the microphone is no longer in use. Notification still appears.
- **focus_detect** (boolean, default: `false`): Honor macOS **Focus / Do Not Disturb**. peon-ping plays sounds via `afplay` and draws overlays in a custom window, and both bypass Notification Center, so the system Focus toggle has no effect on them by default. When enabled, peon-ping reads the Focus state directly and suppresses output whenever **any** Focus (Do Not Disturb, Work, Sleep, etc.) is active, then resumes automatically when you turn Focus off. Mobile push (if configured) is unaffected, since your phone honors its own Focus. macOS only, and it fails open (if the Focus state can't be read, sounds play as normal).
- **focus_detect_mode** (string, default: `"all"`): What `focus_detect` suppresses while a Focus is active. `"all"` mutes both the sound and the overlay/desktop notification. `"sound"` mutes only the sound (notifications still appear). `"notifications"` mutes only the notification (sound still plays). Ignored when `focus_detect` is `false`.
- **notification_position** (string, default: `"top-center"`): Where overlay notifications appear on screen. Options: `"top-left"`, `"top-center"`, `"top-right"`, `"bottom-left"`, `"bottom-center"`, `"bottom-right"`.
- **notification_dismiss_seconds** (number, default: `4`): Auto-dismiss overlay notifications after N seconds. Set to `0` for persistent notifications that require a click to dismiss.
- **notification_all_screens** (boolean, default: `true`): Show overlay notifications on all screens (`true`) or only the main screen (`false`). Themed overlays (`glass`, `jarvis`, `sakura`) previously only showed on one screen — existing configs with those themes are migrated to `false` automatically. macOS only.
- **`CLAUDE_SESSION_NAME` env var**: Set before launching `claude` to give a session a custom name. Shows in both desktop notification titles and terminal tab titles. Priority over all config-based naming. Example: `CLAUDE_SESSION_NAME="Auth Refactor" claude` or `export CLAUDE_SESSION_NAME="Feature: Auth"` then `claude`. Each terminal gets its own title automatically since peon-ping runs as a child of that Claude instance.
- **notification_title_override** (string, default: `""`): Override the project name shown in notification titles. When empty, the project name is auto-detected from `/peon-ping-rename` > `CLAUDE_SESSION_NAME` > `.peon-label` > `notification_title_script` > `project_name_map` > git repo name > folder name.
- **notification_title_marker** (string, default: `"●"`): Character(s) shown before the project name in notification titles and terminal tab titles. Desktop notification titles use `Project` by default; terminal tab titles keep `Project: status`. Set to `""` to disable. Example: `"🔔"`.
- **notification_title_ide** (boolean, default: `false`): Include the normalized IDE label in desktop notification titles as `Project - IDE`. When disabled, the title stays `Project` and the message/body carries the status/details.
- **notification_title_script** (string, default: `""`): Shell command run at event time to compute the project name dynamically. Receives env vars: `PEON_SESSION_ID`, `PEON_CWD`, `PEON_HOOK_EVENT`, `PEON_IDE`, `PEON_SESSION_NAME`. Use stdout (trimmed, max 50 chars); non-zero exit falls through to the next tier. `PEON_IDE` is the normalized IDE/source id such as `codex` or `claude`. Example: `"basename $PEON_CWD"`.
- **project_name_map** (object, default: `{}`): Map directory paths to custom project labels for notifications. Keys are path patterns, values are display names. Example: `{ "/home/user/work/client-a": "Client A" }`.
- **notification_templates** (object, default: `{}`): Custom message/body format strings for notification events. Keys are event types (`stop`, `permission`, `error`, `idle`, `question`), values are template strings with variable substitution. Available variables: `{project}`, `{ide}`, `{ide_id}`, `{summary}`, `{tool_name}`, `{status}`, `{event}`. Example: `{ "stop": "{status}: {summary}", "permission": "{status}: {tool_name}" }`.

### Pack Selection Hierarchy

peon-ping resolves which sound pack to use through a 6-layer hierarchy. The first layer that produces a valid, installed pack wins:

| Priority | Layer | Source | How to set |
|----------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1 (highest) | **session_override** | Per-session assignment | `/peon-ping-use <pack>` skill or MCP |
| 2 | **path_rules** | Glob match on working directory | `peon packs bind` or `path_rules` in config |
| 3 | **ide_rules** | IDE/source match | `peon packs ide-bind` or `ide_rules` in config |
| 4 | **pack_rotation** | Random or round-robin from a list | `pack_rotation` array + `pack_rotation_mode` in config |
| 5 | **default_pack** | Static fallback | `peon packs use <name>` or `default_pack` in config |
| 6 (lowest) | **hardcoded** | Built-in default | `"peon"` |

If a layer references a pack that is not installed, it falls through to the next layer.
If `exclude_dirs` matches the current working directory, the entire invocation is silenced — no sound, no notification.

### Per-Project Pack Assignment (path_rules)

Assign different sound packs to different projects based on directory path. Use the CLI or edit `config.json` directly.

**CLI (recommended):**

```bash
peon packs bind glados                     # Bind glados to the current directory
peon packs bind sc_kerrigan --pattern "*/services/*"  # Bind to a glob pattern
peon packs bind duke_nukem --install       # Bind and install from registry if needed
peon packs unbind                          # Remove binding for the current directory
peon packs unbind --pattern "*/services/*" # Remove a specific pattern binding
peon packs bindings                        # List all bindings
```

**Manual config:**

```json
"path_rules": [
  { "pattern": "*/work/client-a/*", "pack": "glados" },
  { "pattern": "*/personal/*",      "pack": "peon" },
  { "pattern": "*/services/*",      "pack": "sc_kerrigan" }
]
```

Rules use glob matching (`*`, `?`). First matching rule wins. Path rules override `pack_rotation` and `default_pack` but are overridden by `session_override` assignments.

### Per-IDE Pack Assignment (ide_rules)

Use this layer when a path is noisy or shared across tools and you want a pack to follow the IDE instead.

**CLI (recommended):**

```bash
peon packs ide-bind codex glados        # Use glados for Codex sessions
peon packs ide-bind claude peon         # Use peon for Claude Code
peon packs ide-unbind codex             # Remove one IDE rule
peon packs ide-bindings                 # List IDE rules and recent detections
```

**Manual config:**

```json
"ide_rules": [
  { "ide": "codex",  "pack": "glados" },
  { "ide": "claude", "pack": "peon" }
]
```

`ide_rules` run after `path_rules`.

## Common Use Cases

### Sounds without popups

Want voice feedback but no visual distractions?

```bash
peon notifications off
```

This keeps all sound categories playing while suppressing desktop notification banners. Mobile notifications (if configured) continue working.

You can also use the alias:

```bash
peon popups off
```

### Silent mode with notifications only

Want visual alerts but no audio?

```bash
peon pause  # or set "enabled": false in config
```

With `desktop_notifications: true`, you'll get popups but no sounds.

### Complete silence

Disable everything:

```bash
peon pause
peon notifications off
peon mobile off
```

## Peon Trainer

Your peon is also your personal trainer. Built-in Pavel-style daily exercise mode — the same orc who tells you "work work" now tells you to drop and give him twenty.

### Quick start

```bash
peon trainer on              # enable trainer
peon trainer goal 200        # set daily goal (default: 300/300)
# ... code for a while, peon nags you every ~20 min ...
peon trainer log 25 pushups  # log what you did
peon trainer log 30 squats
peon trainer status          # check progress
```

### How it works

Trainer reminders piggyback on your coding session. When you start a new session, the peon immediately encourages you to start strong with pushups before you write any code. Then every ~20 minutes of active coding, you'll hear the peon yelling at you to do more reps. No background daemon needed. Log your reps with `peon trainer log`, and progress resets automatically at midnight.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `peon trainer on` | Enable trainer mode |
| `peon trainer off` | Disable trainer mode |
| `peon trainer status` | Show today's progress |
| `peon trainer log <n> <exercise>` | Log reps (e.g. `log 25 pushups`) |
| `peon trainer goal <n>` | Set uniform daily goal for all exercises |
| `peon trainer goal <exercise> <n>` | Set uniform daily goal for one exercise |
| `peon trainer goal <exercise> <day> <n>` | Set goal for specific day (mon, tue, etc.) |
| `peon trainer goal <day> <n>` | Set all exercises for a specific day |

### Schedule vs uniform goals

Exercises can have either a **uniform daily goal** (same every day) or a **per-day schedule** (different goals on different days). These are mutually exclusive:

- Setting a uniform goal removes any schedule for that exercise
- Setting a day-specific goal removes any uniform goal for that exercise

Days use short names: `mon`, `tue`, `wed`, `thu`, `fri`, `sat`, `sun`

```bash
peon trainer goal pushups 300         # 300 pushups every day (uniform)
peon trainer goal pushups mon 400     # Override: 400 on Monday (creates schedule)
peon trainer goal squats sun 0        # Rest day for squats on Sunday
peon trainer goal fri 150             # Light day for all exercises on Friday
```

On rest days (goal=0), reminders are skipped and status shows `[REST DAY]`. You can still log reps on rest days if you want.

### Claude Code skill

In Claude Code, you can log reps without leaving your conversation:

```
/peon-ping-log 25 pushups
/peon-ping-log 30 squats
```

### Custom voice lines

Drop your own audio files into `~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/trainer/sounds/`:

```
trainer/sounds/session_start/  # session greeting ("Pushups first, code second! Zug zug!")
trainer/sounds/remind/         # reminder lines ("Something need doing? YES. PUSHUPS.")
trainer/sounds/log/            # acknowledgment ("Work work! Muscles getting bigger maybe!")
trainer/sounds/complete/       # celebration ("Zug zug! Human finish all reps!")
trainer/sounds/slacking/       # disappointment ("Peon very disappointed.")
```

Update `trainer/manifest.json` to register your sound files.

## MCP server

peon-ping includes an [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server so any MCP-compatible AI agent can play sounds directly via tool calls — no hooks required.

The key difference: **the agent chooses the sound**. Instead of automatically playing a fixed sound on every event, the agent calls `play_sound` with exactly what it wants — `duke_nukem/SonOfABitch` when a build fails, `sc_kerrigan/IReadYou` when reading files.

### Setup

Add to your MCP client config (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "peon-ping": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/peon-ping/mcp/peon-mcp.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

If installed via Homebrew: `$(brew --prefix peon-ping)/libexec/mcp/peon-mcp.js`. See [`mcp/README.md`](mcp/README.md) for full setup instructions.

### What the agent can do

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **`play_sound`** | Play one or more sounds by key (e.g. `duke_nukem/SonOfABitch`, `peon/PeonReady1`) |
| **`peon-ping://catalog`** | Full pack catalog as an MCP Resource — client prefetches once, no repeated tool calls |
| **`peon-ping://pack/{name}`** | Individual pack details and available sound keys |

Requires Node.js 18+. Contributed by [@tag-assistant](https://github.com/tag-assistant).

## Multi-IDE Support

peon-ping works with any agentic IDE that supports hooks. Adapters translate IDE-specific events to the [CESP standard](https://github.com/PeonPing/openpeon).

| IDE | Status | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | Built-in | `curl \| bash` install handles everything |
| **Amp** | Adapter | `bash adapters/amp.sh` / `powershell adapters/amp.ps1` ([setup](#amp-setup)) |
| **Gemini CLI** | Adapter | Add hooks pointing to `adapters/gemini.sh` (or `.ps1` on Windows) ([setup](#gemini-cli-setup)) |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | Built-in (auto-detect) | `install.sh` / `install.ps1` auto-registers hooks at `~/.copilot/hooks/peon-ping.json` if `~/.copilot` exists. Per-repo manual wiring also available via `adapters/copilot.sh` / `.ps1` ([setup](#github-copilot-cli-setup)) |
| **OpenAI Codex** | Adapter | Install the peon-ping runtime first, then add `notify` in `~/.codex/config.toml` pointing to `adapters/codex.sh` (or `.ps1`) ([setup](#openai-codex-setup)) |
| **Cursor** | Built-in | `curl \| bash`, `peon-ping-setup`, or Windows `install.ps1` auto-detect and register hooks. On Windows, enable **Settings → Features → Third-party skills** so Cursor loads `~/.claude/settings.json` for SessionStart/Stop sounds. |
| **OpenCode** | Adapter | `bash adapters/opencode.sh` / `powershell adapters/opencode.ps1` ([setup](#opencode-setup)) |
| **Kilo CLI** | Adapter | `bash adapters/kilo.sh` / `powershell adapters/kilo.ps1` ([setup](#kilo-cli-setup)) |
| **Kiro** | Adapter | Add hook entries pointing to `adapters/kiro.sh` (or `.ps1`) ([setup](#kiro-setup)) |
| **Windsurf** | Adapter | Add hook entries pointing to `adapters/windsurf.sh` (or `.ps1`) ([setup](#windsurf-setup)) |
| **Google Antigravity** | Adapter | `bash adapters/antigravity.sh` / `powershell adapters/antigravity.ps1`. For headless / macOS LaunchAgent use, also see `bash adapters/antigravity-py.sh --install` (Python `watchdog` watcher with 25s idle threshold; requires `pip3 install watchdog`). The Python watcher supports legacy `conversations/*.pb` state plus newer `antigravity-cli` / `antigravity-ide` `conversations/*.db` and `brain/**/transcript*.jsonl` layouts. |
| **Kimi Code** | Adapter | `bash adapters/kimi.sh --install` / `powershell adapters/kimi.ps1 -Install` ([setup](#kimi-code-setup)) |
| **OpenClaw** | Adapter | Call `adapters/openclaw.sh <event>` (or `openclaw.ps1`) from your OpenClaw skill |
| **Rovo Dev CLI** | Adapter | Auto-registered by `install.sh` if `~/.rovodev` exists, or add hooks to `~/.rovodev/config.yml` manually ([setup](#rovo-dev-cli-setup)) |
| **DeepAgents** | Adapter | `bash adapters/deepagents.sh` / `powershell adapters/deepagents.ps1` ([setup](#deepagents-setup)) |
| **oh-my-pi (omp)** | Adapter | `bash adapters/omp.sh` ([setup](#oh-my-pi-omp-setup)) |
| **Qwen Code** | Adapter | Add hooks pointing to `adapters/qwen.sh` (or `.ps1` on Windows) ([setup](#qwen-code-setup)) |
| **iFlow CLI** | Adapter | Add hooks pointing to `adapters/iflow.sh` (or `.ps1`) ([setup](#iflow-cli-setup)) |
| **Trae** | Adapter | Filesystem watcher: `bash adapters/trae.sh &` / `powershell adapters/trae.ps1 -Install` ([setup](#trae-setup)) |
| **Kiro IDE** | Adapter | Agent hooks in `.kiro/hooks/*.kiro.hook` calling `adapters/kiro-ide.sh` (or `.ps1`) ([setup](#kiro-ide-setup)) |
| **ECA** | Adapter | Add a shell hook pointing to `adapters/eca.sh` (or `.ps1`) ([setup](#eca-setup)) |

> **Windows:** All adapters have native PowerShell (`.ps1`) versions. The Windows installer (`install.ps1`) copies them to `~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/`. Filesystem watchers (Amp, Antigravity, Kimi, Trae) use .NET `FileSystemWatcher` instead of fswatch/inotifywait — no extra dependencies needed.

### OpenAI Codex setup

Codex support uses an adapter and is not auto-registered by `peon-ping-setup`.

The Codex adapter expects the peon-ping runtime to exist at `~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/`, even if you only use Codex and do not use Claude Code.

**Setup:**

1. Install the peon-ping runtime first:

   ```bash
   bash "$(brew --prefix peon-ping)"/libexec/install.sh --no-rc
   ```

   Or with the standard installer:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --no-rc
   ```

2. Add this to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

   ```toml
   notify = ["bash", "~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/codex.sh"]
   ```

3. Restart Codex.

If you installed with Homebrew, the runtime files are managed under `~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/`, and the Codex adapter forwards Codex notify events into that shared runtime.

### Amp setup

A filesystem watcher adapter for [Amp](https://ampcode.com) (by Sourcegraph). Amp doesn't expose event hooks like Claude Code, so this adapter watches Amp's thread files on disk and detects when the agent finishes a turn.

**Setup:**

1. Ensure peon-ping is installed (`curl -fsSL https://peonping.com/install | bash`)

2. Install `fswatch` (macOS) or `inotify-tools` (Linux):

   ```bash
   brew install fswatch        # macOS
   sudo apt install inotify-tools  # Linux
   ```

3. Start the watcher:

   ```bash
   bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/amp.sh        # foreground
   bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/amp.sh &       # background
   ```

**Event mapping:**

- New thread file created → Greeting sound (*"Ready to work?"*, *"Yes?"*)
- Thread file stops updating + agent finished turn → Completion sound (*"Work, work."*, *"Job's done!"*)

**How it works:**

The adapter watches `~/.local/share/amp/threads/` for JSON file changes. When a thread file stops updating (1s idle timeout) and the last message is from the assistant with text content (not a pending tool call), it emits a `Stop` event — meaning the agent is done and waiting for your input.

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AMP_DATA_DIR` | `~/.local/share/amp` | Amp data directory |
| `AMP_THREADS_DIR` | `$AMP_DATA_DIR/threads` | Threads directory to watch |
| `AMP_IDLE_SECONDS` | `1` | Seconds of no changes before emitting Stop |
| `AMP_STOP_COOLDOWN` | `10` | Minimum seconds between Stop events per thread |

### GitHub Copilot CLI setup

Native [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli) integration with full [CESP v1.0](https://github.com/PeonPing/openpeon) conformance.

**Recommended: user-level (global) wiring — no per-repo setup.**

`install.sh` and `install.ps1` automatically register Copilot CLI hooks at `~/.copilot/hooks/peon-ping.json` whenever the `~/.copilot/` directory exists. Re-run the installer if you installed Copilot CLI after peon-ping. The wiring uses **PascalCase event names**, which tells Copilot CLI to deliver the VS Code-compatible (snake_case) payload that `peon.sh` / `peon.ps1` reads natively — no per-repo adapter required.

Hooks registered globally:

| Event | Category | Triggered by |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | `session.start` | Launching `copilot` (greeting) |
| `SessionEnd` | _(silent today)_ | Quitting the CLI |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `user.spam` (after 3+ rapid prompts) | Each prompt you submit |
| `Stop` (= `agentStop`) | `task.complete` | Agent finishes a turn (debounced 5s) |
| `Notification` | `input.required` (elicitation) | Idle, elicitation dialogs, permission popups |
| `PermissionRequest` | `input.required` | Tool permission asks |
| `PreToolUse` | `input.required` (only on dangerous-pattern match) | Before each tool call |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | `task.error` | Tool failure |
| `PreCompact` | `resource.limit` | Context compaction starting |

`postToolUse` is intentionally **not** wired: peon has no `PostToolUse` handler and routing it through `Stop` floods the debounce window, swallowing real `Stop` events.

**Prerequisite (Windows):** Copilot CLI hooks require [PowerShell 7+](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) (`pwsh` on `PATH`) and a permissive execution policy:

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.PowerShell
powershell -NoProfile -Command "Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force"
```

**Alternative: per-repository wiring with the adapter.**

If you want Copilot CLI hooks committed to a specific repository (e.g. for a team workflow), use `.github/hooks/hooks.json` with the `adapters/copilot.sh` (or `.ps1` on Windows) translator:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "sessionStart": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/copilot.sh sessionStart",
        "powershell": "powershell -NoProfile -File %USERPROFILE%\\.claude\\hooks\\peon-ping\\adapters\\copilot.ps1 sessionStart"
      }
    ],
    "agentStop": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/copilot.sh agentStop",
        "powershell": "powershell -NoProfile -File %USERPROFILE%\\.claude\\hooks\\peon-ping\\adapters\\copilot.ps1 agentStop"
      }
    ],
    "postToolUseFailure": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/copilot.sh postToolUseFailure",
        "powershell": "powershell -NoProfile -File %USERPROFILE%\\.claude\\hooks\\peon-ping\\adapters\\copilot.ps1 postToolUseFailure"
      }
    ],
    "notification": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/copilot.sh notification",
        "powershell": "powershell -NoProfile -File %USERPROFILE%\\.claude\\hooks\\peon-ping\\adapters\\copilot.ps1 notification"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Add additional events from the table above as desired. The adapter translates Copilot CLI's camelCase payload (`sessionId`, `toolName`, `stopReason`, etc.) to the snake_case shape (`session_id`, `tool_name`, `stop_reason`) that `peon.sh` / `peon.ps1` reads.

**Features:**

- **Sound playback** via `afplay` (macOS), `pw-play`/`paplay`/`ffplay` (Linux), `MediaPlayer`/`SoundPlayer` (Windows) — same priority chain as the shell hook
- **CESP event mapping** — Copilot CLI hooks map to standard CESP categories (`session.start`, `task.complete`, `task.error`, `input.required`, `user.spam`, `resource.limit`)
- **Desktop notifications** — large overlay banners by default, or standard notifications
- **Spam detection** — detects 3+ rapid prompts within 10 seconds, triggers `user.spam` voice lines
- **Debouncing** — `Stop` events suppressed within a 5s window to prevent spam from chained tool calls


### OpenCode setup

A native TypeScript plugin for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) with full [CESP v1.0](https://github.com/PeonPing/openpeon) conformance.

**Quick install:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/main/adapters/opencode.sh | bash
```

The installer copies `peon-ping.ts` to `~/.config/opencode/plugins/` and creates a config at `~/.config/opencode/peon-ping/config.json`. Packs are stored at the shared CESP path (`~/.openpeon/packs/`).

**Features:**

- **Sound playback** via `afplay` (macOS), `pw-play`/`paplay`/`ffplay` (Linux) — same priority chain as the shell hook
- **CESP event mapping** — `session.created` / `session.idle` / `session.error` / `permission.asked` / rapid prompt detection all map to standard CESP categories
- **Desktop notifications** — large overlay banners by default (JXA Cocoa, visible on all screens), or standard notifications via [`terminal-notifier`](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier) / `osascript`. Fires only when the terminal is not focused.
- **Terminal focus detection** — checks if your terminal app (Terminal, iTerm2, Warp, Alacritty, kitty, WezTerm, ghostty, Hyper) is frontmost via AppleScript before sending notifications
- **Tab titles** — updates the terminal tab to show task status (`● project: working...` / `✓ project: done` / `✗ project: error`)
- **Pack switching** — reads `default_pack` from config (with `active_pack` fallback for legacy configs), loads the pack's `openpeon.json` manifest at runtime. `path_rules` can override the pack per working directory.
- **No-repeat logic** — avoids playing the same sound twice in a row per category
- **Spam detection** — detects 3+ rapid prompts within 10 seconds, triggers `user.spam` voice lines

<summary>🎨 Optional: custom peon icon for notifications</summary>

By default, `terminal-notifier` shows a generic Terminal icon. The included script replaces it with the peon icon using built-in macOS tools (`sips` + `iconutil`) — no extra dependencies.

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/main/adapters/opencode/setup-icon.sh)
```

Or if installed locally (Homebrew / git clone):

```bash
bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/opencode/setup-icon.sh
```

The script auto-finds the peon icon (Homebrew libexec, OpenCode config, or Claude hooks dir), generates a proper `.icns`, backs up the original `Terminal.icns`, and replaces it. Re-run after `brew upgrade terminal-notifier`.

> **Future:** When [jamf/Notifier](https://github.com/jamf/Notifier) ships to Homebrew ([#32](https://github.com/jamf/Notifier/issues/32)), the plugin will migrate to it — Notifier has built-in `--rebrand` support, no icon hacks needed.

### Kilo CLI setup

A native TypeScript plugin for [Kilo CLI](https://github.com/kilocode/cli) with full [CESP v1.0](https://github.com/PeonPing/openpeon) conformance. Kilo CLI is a fork of OpenCode and uses the same plugin system — this installer downloads the OpenCode plugin and patches it for Kilo.

**Quick install:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/main/adapters/kilo.sh | bash
```

The installer copies `peon-ping.ts` to `~/.config/kilo/plugins/` and creates a config at `~/.config/kilo/peon-ping/config.json`. Packs are stored at the shared CESP path (`~/.openpeon/packs/`).

**Features:** Same as the [OpenCode adapter](#opencode-setup) — sound playback, CESP event mapping, desktop notifications, terminal focus detection, tab titles, pack switching, no-repeat logic, and spam detection.

### Gemini CLI setup

A shell adapter for **Gemini CLI** with full [CESP v1.0](https://github.com/PeonPing/openpeon) conformance.

**Setup:**

1. Ensure peon-ping is installed (`curl -fsSL https://peonping.com/install | bash`)

2. Add the following hooks to your `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

   ```json
    {
      "hooks": {
        "SessionStart": [
          {
            "matcher": "startup",
            "hooks": [
              {
                "name": "peon-start",
                "type": "command",
                "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/gemini.sh SessionStart"
              }
            ]
          }
        ],
        "AfterAgent": [
          {
            "matcher": "*",
            "hooks": [
              {
                "name": "peon-after-agent",
                "type": "command",
                "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/gemini.sh AfterAgent"
              }
            ]
          }
        ],
        "AfterTool": [
          {
            "matcher": "*",
            "hooks": [
              {
                "name": "peon-after-tool",
                "type": "command",
                "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/gemini.sh AfterTool"
              }
            ]
          }
        ],
        "Notification": [
          {
            "matcher": "*",
            "hooks": [
              {
                "name": "peon-notification",
                "type": "command",
                "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/gemini.sh Notification"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
   ```

**Event mapping:**

- `SessionStart` (startup) → Greeting sound (*"Ready to work?"*, *"Yes?"*)
- `AfterAgent` → Task completion sound (*"Work, work."*, *"Job's done!"*)
- `AfterTool` → Success = Task completion sound, Failure = Error sound (*"I can't do that."*)
- `Notification` → System notification

### Windsurf setup

Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/hooks.json` (user-level) or `.windsurf/hooks.json` (workspace-level):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "post_cascade_response": [
      { "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/windsurf.sh post_cascade_response", "show_output": false }
    ],
    "pre_user_prompt": [
      { "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/windsurf.sh pre_user_prompt", "show_output": false }
    ],
    "post_write_code": [
      { "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/windsurf.sh post_write_code", "show_output": false }
    ],
    "post_run_command": [
      { "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/windsurf.sh post_run_command", "show_output": false }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Kiro setup

Create `~/.kiro/agents/peon-ping.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "peon-ping",
  "hooks": {
    "agentSpawn": [
      { "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/kiro.sh" }
    ],
    "userPromptSubmit": [
      { "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/kiro.sh" }
    ],
    "stop": [
      { "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/kiro.sh" }
    ]
  }
}
```

`preToolUse`/`postToolUse` are intentionally excluded — they fire on every tool call and would be extremely noisy.

### Rovo Dev CLI setup

A shell adapter for [Rovo Dev CLI](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/rovo/) (Atlassian) with full [CESP v1.0](https://github.com/PeonPing/openpeon) conformance.

**Auto-setup:**

If `~/.rovodev/config.yml` exists when you run `install.sh` or `peon-ping-setup`, event hooks are registered automatically.

**Manual setup:**

1. Ensure peon-ping is installed (`curl -fsSL https://peonping.com/install | bash`)

2. Add to `~/.rovodev/config.yml`:

   ```yaml
   eventHooks:
     events:
       - name: on_complete
         commands:
           - command: bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/rovodev.sh on_complete
       - name: on_error
         commands:
           - command: bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/rovodev.sh on_error
       - name: on_tool_permission
         commands:
           - command: bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/rovodev.sh on_tool_permission
   ```

3. Restart Rovo Dev CLI for the hooks to take effect.

**Event mapping:**

- `on_complete` → Completion sound (*"Work, work."*, *"Job's done!"*)
- `on_error` → Error sound (*"I can't do that."*, *"Son of a bitch!"*)
- `on_tool_permission` → Permission prompt sound (*"Something need doing?"*, *"Hmm?"*)

**Features:**

- **Sound playback** via `afplay` (macOS), `pw-play`/`paplay`/`ffplay` (Linux) — same priority chain as the shell hook
- **CESP event mapping** — Rovo Dev events map to standard CESP categories (`task.complete`, `task.error`, `input.required`)
- **Desktop notifications** — large overlay banners by default, or standard notifications
- **Debounce** — suppresses duplicate sounds from rapid completions

### Kimi Code setup

A filesystem watcher adapter for [Kimi Code CLI](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli) (MoonshotAI). Kimi Code writes Wire Mode events to `~/.kimi/sessions/` — this adapter watches those files as a background daemon and translates events to CESP format.

```bash
# Install (starts background daemon)
bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/kimi.sh --install

# Check status / stop
bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/kimi.sh --status
bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/kimi.sh --uninstall
```

Requires `fswatch` (`brew install fswatch`) on macOS or `inotifywait` (`apt install inotify-tools`) on Linux. The `curl | bash` installer auto-detects Kimi Code and starts the daemon.

**On macOS, `--install` registers a LaunchAgent** at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.peonping.kimi-adapter.plist` so the watcher auto-starts on login and auto-restarts on crash — survives reboots without re-running `--install`. Set `KIMI_NO_LAUNCHD=1` to fall back to `nohup`+pidfile (e.g. for tests). Linux always uses `nohup`+pidfile.

**Kimi-only install (no Claude required):**

If you don't have Claude Code and just want peon-ping for Kimi, install with `--kimi`:

```bash
curl -fsSL peonping.com/install | bash -s -- --kimi
```

Files land in `~/.kimi/hooks/peon-ping/` instead of `~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/`, and no `~/.claude/` directory is created. The installer also auto-detects this layout: running it with no flags on a machine that has `~/.kimi/` but no `~/.claude/` selects `--kimi` mode automatically. The watcher daemon starts during install and re-starts on every login via the LaunchAgent.

**Sharing voice packs with a Claude install:**

If `~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/packs/` already exists with packs, a `--kimi` install symlinks `~/.kimi/hooks/peon-ping/packs` at it instead of re-downloading. One pack download serves both IDEs, and `peon packs install <name>` from either side updates the shared set. State, config, and mute toggles stay isolated per install. Pass `--no-shared-packs` (or `--packs=` / `--all`) to download a separate copy.

**Event mapping:**

- New session → Greeting sound (*"Ready to work?"*, *"Yes?"*)
- Agent finishes turn → Completion sound (*"Work, work."*, *"Job's done!"*)
- Context compaction → Token limit sound
- Sub-agent spawned → Sub-agent tracking

### Tool-agnostic install root (`--openpeon`)

Install everything (hooks, packs, `settings.json`) under `~/.openpeon` instead of `~/.claude`:

```bash
curl -fsSL peonping.com/install | bash -s -- --openpeon
# Windows: powershell -File install.ps1 -OpenPeon
```

Useful for an OpenPeon-branded or tool-agnostic setup: `peon.sh` auto-discovers `~/.openpeon/packs` via its packs-anchored fallback, so adapters pointed at that root work without `~/.claude`. The same reroot is also available with no flag via `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.openpeon bash install.sh`.

### oh-my-pi (omp) setup

A native TypeScript extension for [oh-my-pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) (`omp`) with full [CESP v1.0](https://github.com/PeonPing/openpeon) conformance. Subscribes to omp's `ExtensionAPI` lifecycle events and routes them through `peon.sh` so omp users get every peon-ping feature: sound packs, desktop notifications, trainer reminders, mobile push, SSH/devcontainer relay, and tab-title updates.

**Quick install:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/main/adapters/omp.sh | bash
```

The installer copies `peon-ping.ts` and `package.json` to `~/.omp/agent/extensions/peon-ping/`. Restart omp afterward.

**Event mapping:**

| omp event                              | peon-ping event       |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `session_start`                        | `SessionStart`        |
| `turn_start`                           | `UserPromptSubmit`    |
| `turn_end`                             | `Stop`                |
| `tool_result` with `isError: true`     | `PostToolUseFailure`  |
| `auto_compaction_start`                | `PreCompact`          |
| `session_shutdown`                     | `SessionEnd`          |

**Uninstall:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/main/adapters/omp.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
```

### Qwen Code setup

A thin passthrough adapter for [Qwen Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code) (Alibaba). Qwen Code ships a Claude-Code-style hook system — events are piped as JSON on stdin using the same PascalCase CESP names peon-ping expects — so this adapter simply re-tags the session id with a `qwen-` prefix and drops the noisy per-tool-call events.

Add to `~/.qwen/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart":       [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/qwen.sh" }] }],
    "UserPromptSubmit":   [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/qwen.sh" }] }],
    "Stop":               [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/qwen.sh" }] }],
    "Notification":       [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/qwen.sh" }] }],
    "PostToolUseFailure": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/qwen.sh" }] }],
    "SessionEnd":         [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/qwen.sh" }] }]
  }
}
```

On Windows, point the command at `qwen.ps1` via `powershell -NoProfile -File %USERPROFILE%\.claude\hooks\peon-ping\adapters\qwen.ps1`.

### iFlow CLI setup

A passthrough adapter for [iFlow CLI](https://cli.iflow.cn) (iflow-ai). iFlow ships a Claude-Code-style hook system (PascalCase events on stdin); this adapter forwards the meaningful lifecycle events with an `iflow-` session prefix and maps a failed `PostToolUse` to `PostToolUseFailure`.

Add to `~/.iflow/settings.json` (or per-project `./.iflow/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart":     [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/iflow.sh" }] }],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/iflow.sh" }] }],
    "Stop":             [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/iflow.sh" }] }],
    "Notification":     [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/iflow.sh" }] }],
    "PostToolUse":      [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/iflow.sh" }] }],
    "SessionEnd":       [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/iflow.sh" }] }]
  }
}
```

### Trae setup

A filesystem-watcher adapter for [Trae](https://trae.ai) (ByteDance). Trae is a VS Code-derived AI IDE with no synchronous shell-hook API, so peon-ping uses the same watcher approach as Amp and Antigravity: a new session file means `SessionStart`, and an idle timer (the session file stops updating) means `Stop`.

```bash
# Foreground
bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/trae.sh
# Background
bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/trae.sh &
```

On Windows: `powershell -File adapters\trae.ps1 -Install` registers a background watcher (`-Status` / `-Uninstall` to manage it).

Trae's on-disk session layout varies by platform/version and isn't publicly documented, so the watched paths are environment-overridable:

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `TRAE_DATA_DIR` | `~/.trae` |
| `TRAE_SESSIONS_DIR` | `$TRAE_DATA_DIR/sessions` |
| `TRAE_SESSION_GLOB` | `*.json` |

Requires `fswatch` (macOS: `brew install fswatch`) or `inotifywait` (Linux: `apt install inotify-tools`). Windows uses .NET `FileSystemWatcher` — no extra dependency.

### Kiro IDE setup

A hook adapter for **Kiro IDE** (Amazon) — distinct from the [Kiro CLI](#kiro-setup) (`adapters/kiro.sh`). The IDE's Agent Hooks are `.kiro/hooks/*.kiro.hook` JSON files; their `then.type: runCommand` action runs a shell command with **no stdin JSON**, passing the triggering event name to the adapter as an argv argument.

Create one hook file per event, e.g. `.kiro/hooks/peon-ping-stop.kiro.hook`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "enabled": true,
  "name": "peon-ping-stop",
  "when": { "type": "agentStop" },
  "then": {
    "type": "runCommand",
    "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/kiro-ide.sh agentStop"
  }
}
```

Repeat with `when.type` = `promptSubmit` (→ `UserPromptSubmit`), `preToolUse` (→ permission prompt), or `sessionStart` (→ `SessionStart`), each passing the matching event name as the command argument. `postToolUse` and file/user-triggered hooks carry no peon-relevant signal and are ignored. On Windows, point the command at `kiro-ide.ps1` via `powershell -NoProfile -File`.

### ECA setup

A shell-hook adapter for [ECA](https://eca.dev) (Editor Code Assistant), an editor-agnostic LLM-agent integration. ECA pipes JSON on stdin (snake_case top-level keys) and also passes the hook type as an argv argument; this adapter maps ECA's events to CESP with a stable `eca-` session prefix derived from the ECA `db_cache_path`. Originally contributed in PeonPing/peon-ping#261, vendored first-party here.

Add a shell hook to your ECA config pointing at the adapter, one per event:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "sessionStart": [{ "actions": [{ "type": "shell", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/eca.sh sessionStart" }] }],
    "preRequest":   [{ "actions": [{ "type": "shell", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/eca.sh preRequest" }] }],
    "postRequest":  [{ "actions": [{ "type": "shell", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/eca.sh postRequest" }] }],
    "preToolCall":  [{ "actions": [{ "type": "shell", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/eca.sh preToolCall" }] }],
    "sessionEnd":   [{ "actions": [{ "type": "shell", "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/eca.sh sessionEnd" }] }]
  }
}
```

**Event mapping:** `sessionStart`/`chatStart` → `SessionStart`, `preRequest` → `UserPromptSubmit`, `postRequest`/`subagentPostRequest`/`postToolCall` → `Stop`, `preToolCall` → permission prompt, `sessionEnd` → `SessionEnd`.

## Remote development (SSH / Devcontainers / Codespaces)

Coding on a remote server or inside a container? peon-ping auto-detects SSH sessions, devcontainers, and Codespaces, then routes audio and notifications through a lightweight relay running on your local machine.

### SSH setup

1. **On your local machine**, start the relay:
   ```bash
   peon relay --daemon
   ```

2. **SSH with port forwarding**:
   ```bash
   ssh -R 19998:localhost:19998 your-server
   ```

3. **Install peon-ping on the remote** — it auto-detects the SSH session and sends audio requests back through the forwarded port to your local relay.

That's it. Sounds play on your laptop, not the remote server.

Optional SSH routing modes:

```bash
peon ssh-audio relay   # default, always use relay
peon ssh-audio auto    # try relay, fall back to local playback on SSH host
peon ssh-audio local   # always play on SSH host
```

### Devcontainers / Codespaces

No port forwarding needed — peon-ping auto-detects `REMOTE_CONTAINERS` and `CODESPACES` environment variables and routes audio to `host.docker.internal:19998`. Just run `peon relay --daemon` on your host machine.

### Relay commands

```bash
peon relay                # Start relay in foreground
peon relay --daemon       # Start in background
peon relay --stop         # Stop background relay
peon relay --status       # Check if relay is running
peon relay --port=12345   # Custom port (default: 19998)
peon relay --bind=0.0.0.0 # Listen on all interfaces (less secure)
```

Environment variables: `PEON_RELAY_PORT`, `PEON_RELAY_HOST`, `PEON_RELAY_BIND`.

If peon-ping detects an SSH or container session but can't reach the relay, it prints setup instructions on `SessionStart`.

### Category-based API (for lightweight remote hooks)

The relay supports a category-based endpoint that handles sound selection server-side. This is useful for remote machines where peon-ping isn't installed — the remote hook only needs to send a category name, and the relay picks a random sound from the active pack.

**Endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Health check (returns "OK") |
| `GET /play?file=<path>` | Play a specific sound file (legacy) |
| `GET /play?category=<cat>` | Play random sound from category (recommended) |
| `POST /notify` | Send desktop notification |

**Example remote hook (`scripts/remote-hook.sh`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
RELAY_URL="${PEON_RELAY_URL:-http://127.0.0.1:19998}"
EVENT=$(cat | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d.get('hook_event_name',''))" 2>/dev/null)
case "$EVENT" in
  SessionStart)      CATEGORY="session.start" ;;
  Stop)              CATEGORY="task.complete" ;;
  PermissionRequest) CATEGORY="input.required" ;;
  *)                 exit 0 ;;
esac
curl -sf "${RELAY_URL}/play?category=${CATEGORY}" >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```

Copy this to your remote machine and register it in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{"command": "bash /path/to/remote-hook.sh"}],
    "Stop": [{"command": "bash /path/to/remote-hook.sh"}],
    "PermissionRequest": [{"command": "bash /path/to/remote-hook.sh"}]
  }
}
```

The relay reads `config.json` on your local machine to get the active pack and volume, loads the pack's manifest, and picks a random sound while avoiding repeats.

## Mobile notifications

Get push notifications on your phone when tasks finish or need attention — useful when you're away from your desk.

### Quick start (ntfy.sh — free, no account needed)

1. Install the [ntfy app](https://ntfy.sh) on your phone
2. Subscribe to a unique topic in the app (e.g. `my-peon-notifications`)
3. Run:
   ```bash
   peon mobile ntfy my-peon-notifications
   ```

Also supports [Pushover](https://pushover.net) and [Telegram](https://core.telegram.org/bots):

```bash
peon mobile pushover <user_key> <app_token>
peon mobile telegram <bot_token> <chat_id>
```

### Notification priority (ntfy)

By default peon-ping derives the ntfy priority from the event type (permission
prompts are `high`, routine events `default`/`low`). On iOS the lower tiers can
arrive **silently** (the banner shows but no sound plays). Set an explicit
priority to make alerts audible:

```bash
peon mobile ntfy my-peon-notifications --priority=max
```

You can also add a `priority` key to `mobile_notify` in `config.json`:

```json
"mobile_notify": {
  "service": "ntfy",
  "topic": "my-peon-notifications",
  "server": "https://ntfy.sh",
  "priority": "max"
}
```

Accepted values are ntfy priority names (`max`/`urgent`, `high`, `default`,
`low`, `min`) or numbers `1` to `5`. When set, it applies to every event,
overriding the per-event default; leave it unset to keep the original behavior.
The same value also maps to Pushover priorities for that service.

### Mobile commands

```bash
peon mobile on            # Enable mobile notifications
peon mobile off           # Disable mobile notifications
peon mobile status        # Show current config
peon mobile test          # Send a test notification
```

Mobile notifications fire on every event regardless of window focus — they're independent from desktop notifications and sounds.

## Sound packs

**[Browse all packs with audio previews &rarr; openpeon.com/packs](https://openpeon.com/packs)**

Install all with `--all`, or switch packs anytime:

```bash
peon packs use glados             # switch to a specific pack
peon packs use --install glados   # install (or update) and switch in one step
peon packs next                   # cycle to the next pack
peon packs list                   # list all installed packs
peon packs list --registry        # browse all available packs
peon packs install glados,murloc  # install specific packs
peon packs install --all          # install every pack in the registry
```

## Debugging

When sounds aren't playing or notifications aren't appearing, structured debug logging helps you trace exactly what happened during a hook invocation.

### Enabling debug logs

```bash
peon debug on             # Enable — logs written to ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/logs/
peon debug off            # Disable
peon debug status         # Show state, log directory, file count, total size
```

You can also enable debug logging per-invocation without changing config by setting the environment variable `PEON_DEBUG=1`.

### Reading logs

```bash
peon logs                 # Last 50 lines of today's log
peon logs --last 100      # Last 100 lines across all log files
peon logs --session <ID>  # Filter today's log by session ID
peon logs --session <ID> --all  # Search all log files for session ID
peon logs --clear         # Delete all log files (with confirmation)
```

### Log format

Each log line is a structured key=value record:

```
2026-03-26T14:32:01.042 [config] inv=a3f1 loaded=/path/to/config.json volume=0.5 pack=peon enabled=True
2026-03-26T14:32:01.045 [event] inv=a3f1 hook_event=Stop cesp=task.complete session=abc123
2026-03-26T14:32:01.048 [sound] inv=a3f1 file=work-work.wav label="Work, work." category=task.complete
2026-03-26T14:32:01.120 [play] inv=a3f1 player=afplay file=work-work.wav
2026-03-26T14:32:01.125 [notify] inv=a3f1 title="peon: done" body="Work, work."
```

- **inv** -- unique 4-character invocation ID linking all phases of a single hook call
- **Phases**: `[config]`, `[event]`, `[sound]`, `[play]`, `[notify]` -- each represents a stage in the hook pipeline
- Values containing spaces or special characters are quoted

### Common failure examples

| Symptom | What to look for in logs |
|---|---|
| No sound plays | `[event]` line shows `exit=early` (category disabled, paused, or debounced) |
| Wrong pack | `[config]` line shows unexpected `pack=` value -- check path_rules or rotation |
| Missing sound file | `[sound]` line shows `error=` with file path |
| Notification missing | `[notify]` line absent -- check `desktop_notifications` in config |

### Config keys

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `debug` | `false` | Enable structured debug logging |
| `debug_retention_days` | `7` | Auto-prune logs older than N days |

Logs are stored at `~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/logs/peon-ping-YYYY-MM-DD.log` (one file per day). Old logs are automatically pruned based on `debug_retention_days` when a new day's log is created.

## Uninstall

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}"/hooks/peon-ping/uninstall.sh        # global
bash .claude/hooks/peon-ping/uninstall.sh           # project-local
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Standard uninstall (prompts before deleting sounds)
powershell -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\hooks\peon-ping\uninstall.ps1"

# Keep sound packs (removes everything else)
powershell -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\hooks\peon-ping\uninstall.ps1" -KeepSounds
```

## Requirements

- **macOS** — `afplay` (built-in), JXA Cocoa overlay or AppleScript for notifications
- **Linux** — one of: `pw-play`, `paplay`, `ffplay`, `mpv`, `play` (SoX), or `aplay`; `notify-send` for notifications
- **Windows** — native PowerShell with `MediaPlayer` and WinForms (no WSL required), or WSL2
- **MSYS2 / Git Bash** — `python3`, `cygpath` (built-in); audio via `ffplay`/`mpv`/`play` or PowerShell fallback
- **All platforms** — `python3` (not required for native Windows)
- **SSH/remote** — `curl` on the remote host
- **IDE** — Claude Code with hooks support, Amp, or any supported IDE via [adapters](#multi-ide-support)

## How it works

`peon.sh` is a Claude Code hook registered for `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `SubagentStart`, `Stop`, `Notification`, `PermissionRequest`, `PostToolUseFailure`, and `PreCompact` events. On each event:

1. **Event mapping** — an embedded Python block maps the hook event to a [CESP](https://github.com/PeonPing/openpeon) sound category (`session.start`, `task.complete`, `input.required`, etc.)
2. **Sound selection** — picks a random voice line from the active pack's manifest, avoiding repeats
3. **Audio playback** — plays the sound asynchronously via `afplay` (macOS), PowerShell `MediaPlayer` (WSL2/MSYS2 fallback), or `pw-play`/`paplay`/`ffplay`/`mpv`/`aplay` (Linux/MSYS2)
4. **Notifications** — updates the Terminal tab title and sends a desktop notification if the terminal isn't focused
5. **Remote routing** — in SSH sessions, devcontainers, and Codespaces, audio and notification requests are forwarded over HTTP to a [relay server](#remote-development-ssh--devcontainers--codespaces) on your local machine

Sound packs are downloaded from the [OpenPeon registry](https://github.com/PeonPing/registry) at install time. The official packs are hosted in [PeonPing/og-packs](https://github.com/PeonPing/og-packs). Sound files are property of their respective publishers (Blizzard, Valve, EA, etc.) and are distributed under fair use for personal notification purposes.
